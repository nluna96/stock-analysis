# stock-analysis

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to get a better understanding of the provided stock market data. Being able analyse this data will help Steve make a data-driven decision when he helps his parents find a profitable stock. At the moment Steve has no efficent way to process this stock market data. Steve could do this by hand but it would take a large amount of time to process every single row. Steve is fortunate that Microsoft Excel has the programing language Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) which makes repetitive calculation in an extremely short amount of time. In this project VBA plays a big role in processing about 3000 rows in about .59 seconds. Steve can now focus on analysing the results and make comparisons within each stock.
